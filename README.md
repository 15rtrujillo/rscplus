## Download
There are two ways to obtain the client mod.

- Building from source and reviewing the code, see the above section labeled **Building**. *(Recommended)*
- Downloading the build I uploaded [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61045381/rscplus.zip) for the latest revision. *(Not Recommended, but if you must...)*

I'm only providing that download link so people don't go around asking others to build it for them and risk them modifying it on them.
